## What is Arazzo?

Arazzo is an official specification from the **OpenAPI Initiative**, joining the well-known OpenAPI Specification (OAS) and the Overlay Specification. While OAS describes individual APIs, **Arazzo defines workflows that orchestrate calls across one or more APIs**.

### Why Arazzo Matters

- **Standardized API Orchestration**: Language-agnostic workflow definitions
- **Human & Machine Readable**: Clear documentation that tools can execute
- **Ecosystem Ready**: Enables automation, testing, and AI-driven API interactions

### Real-World Applications

- Interactive workflow documentation
- Automated testing and validation
- Code and SDK generation
- AI agent API interactions
- DevOps automation pipelines

---

## Projects

This monorepo contains two complementary tools for the Arazzo ecosystem:

### üèÉ [Arazzo Runner](./runner/)

Execute Arazzo workflows with full specification compliance.

```bash
# Execute a workflow
arazzo-runner execute workflow.arazzo.yaml --input '{"userId": 123}'
```

**Features:**
- Complete Arazzo 1.0 specification support
- Authentication handling (OAuth2, API keys, etc.)
- Conditional logic and error handling
- Extensive validation and debugging
- Python library and CLI tool

[**Explore the Runner ‚Üí**](./runner/)

### ‚öôÔ∏è [Arazzo Generator](./generator/)

Generate Arazzo workflows from OpenAPI specifications using AI-powered analysis.

```bash
# Generate workflows from OpenAPI spec
arazzo-generator generate https://api.example.com/openapi.json -o workflows.arazzo.yaml
```

**Features:**
- LLM-powered workflow identification
- OpenAPI 3.0 and 3.1 support
- Multiple output formats (JSON/YAML)
- Batch processing capabilities
- FastAPI web interface

[**Explore the Generator ‚Üí**](./generator/)

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- [PDM](https://pdm.fming.dev/) (recommended) or pip

### Installation

Choose your preferred installation method:

#### Option 1: Install from PyPI
```bash
# Install both tools
pip install arazzo-runner arazzo-generator

# Or install individually
pip install arazzo-runner
pip install arazzo-generator
```

#### Option 2: Development Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jentic/arazzo-engine.git
cd arazzo-engine

# Setup development environment
./scripts/setup.sh

# Or setup manually
cd generator && pdm install && cd ..
cd runner && pdm install && cd ..
```

### Your First Workflow

1. **Generate a workflow from an OpenAPI spec:**
   ```bash
   arazzo-generator generate https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json -o petstore.arazzo.yaml
   ```

2. **Execute the workflow:**
   ```bash
   arazzo-runner execute petstore.arazzo.yaml --input '{"status": "available"}'
   ```

3. **View results:**
   ```bash
   cat execution_results.json
   ```
