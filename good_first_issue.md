# Good First Issue Guide

Welcome to the Arazzo Engine project! We're excited to have you contribute during Hacktoberfest and beyond.

## What is a Good First Issue?

Good first issues are beginner-friendly tasks that help you get familiar with our codebase while making meaningful contributions. These issues typically:

- Have clear, step-by-step instructions
- Don't require deep knowledge of the entire codebase
- Can be completed in a few hours
- Have well-defined acceptance criteria
